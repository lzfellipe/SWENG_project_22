        biography: "Davids love for videography started once he left secondary school. He saw people he knew making amazing video content for brands and was stunned by the creativity & imagination. Before he knew it, he was saving up for his first videocamera - a Lumix G7. David started making fun videos of friends and families on holidays or special occasions. He used this footage to improve his skills both on the camera and when using Adobe Premiere Pro editing tools. After 2 years, he had improved massively,  generating a style of his own. Ready to take it to the next step, David is looking to now work with real clients to build up his portfolio. Davids videos are simplistic in nature, letting his storytelling capabilities create an emotional, genuine and transparent energy in each production",
